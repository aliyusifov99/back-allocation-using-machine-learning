# Back Allocation Using Machine Learning ‚öôÔ∏è

## Overview

The "Back Allocation Using Machine Learning" project focuses on calculating back allocation in oil and gas wells through advanced machine learning techniques. This process involves analyzing production data from multiple wells to determine their individual contributions to the overall production. Explore the project [here](https://github.com/aliyusifov99/back-allocation-using-machine-learning).

## Inspiration üí°

This project aims to enhance the accuracy of back allocation calculations in the oil and gas industry. By employing machine learning models, the project seeks to provide a more data-driven approach to understanding individual well performances, which is crucial for effective reservoir management.

## Features üåü

- **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth analysis and preprocessing of well data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning Models for Allocation**: Utilization of Random Forest and XGBoost regressors for accurate back allocation calculation.
- **Model Comparison and Tuning**: Implementation of hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models, with a visual comparison of results.
